# Event-Based Vision Data Analysis

A Python toolkit for analyzing and visualizing event-based camera data statistics, focusing on spatial and temporal event distributions.

## Features

- **3D Spatial Visualization**: Generate 3D surface plots showing event density distributions across spatial coordinates
- **Comprehensive Flux Statistics**: Analyze event density, counts, polarity ratios, and pixel occupancy
- **Train/Test Comparison**: Side-by-side statistical comparison between training and test datasets
- **Summary Statistics**: Detailed numerical summaries with mean and standard deviation metrics

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
